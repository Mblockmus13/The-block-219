<section> <strong>Why everyone needs to care less about the console wars!</strong></section> Honestly we have so many more issues then the console wars.If we care less about the console wars and just play the games like we are supposed to do than we could have so fun!
  <section> <strong>Steam hacked?</strong></section> I mean i was so shocked when i heard that steam got hacked by teenagers! trying to publish a fake app that had a virus in it's coding which i found dissapointing because Steam offers workshops for developers like myself and we abused the privilege and now in the future we are going to pay for it. 
<section> <strong>Game prices!</strong></section> a few year's ago games used to cost twenty to thirty dollars canadian which is not bad...A few years later i go to buy Destiny:The taken king
for seventy dollars canadian!!! Thats crazy!!! Commpared to what it used to be...i am speechless.
  <section> <strong>Gaming Next Generation</strong></section> Yes we are talking the Wii U,Xbox one and PS4. Now my next question is are they Oculus ready? and if they are is it going to be like Steam VR? all those questions where are the answers! Thats where i come in the only system right now that's currently VR ready is PC beacause of the hardware specs.
